<h1>SLProject</h2>

<p>SLapp allows users to visualise the location of Stockholm subway system's (SL) ticket controllers in real time. 
It collects data from @SLbiljett Twitter feed where users update on the current/latest SL controllers' location
around the subway system and marks their location on a map. 
As Hyper Island students we were faced with the challenge of using open data for our project.
Visualising data on a map in real time was particularly challenging for us,
technically, a challenge that kept us busy for many weeks. 
This is the result of our effort and in the spirit of open source we want to challenge others 
to take the idea further and develop it. </p>
